Storylet 3	Intro To Quest Descriptions	Guild	Wavy-Haired Clerk	The Quest Stat Summary isn't always the best thing to match. Often quests will be very nuanced, and the Stat Summary is only there as a judge of the maximum difficulty that'll get your adventurer's home. This quest description will ask you to send good negotiators, and avoid sending aggravating characters.

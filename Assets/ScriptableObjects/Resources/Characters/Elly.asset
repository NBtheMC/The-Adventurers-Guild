  Biography: "An epicurean, hedonistic vampire who hides within the somber cathedrals
    of the Order. Dislikes light, but their name, Ellanore, means \u201Cshining light.\u201D
    Wants to see new and interesting places, but hates travelling. Everything about
    them is oxymoronic. Also probably older than time itself.   Likes interesting
    things. Great with fighting and talking, but terrible with anything outdoors-related.
    Insists on being called Elly. "

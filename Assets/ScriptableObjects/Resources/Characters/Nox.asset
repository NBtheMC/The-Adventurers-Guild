  Biography: An ally? of questionable character and loyalty. Must be paid upfront.
    A master of disguise of Elvish? origin. Someone somewhere must know more about
    them, but prying around for that information is going to cost you, big time. 
    Is very loyal to large piles of cash. Great at literally everything. No one knows
    their real name.

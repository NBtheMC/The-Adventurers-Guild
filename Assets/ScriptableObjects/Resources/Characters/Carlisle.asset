  Biography: "A career mercenary that takes very good care of their giant tower shield,
    which in turn takes very good care of their allies. Tends to style themself as
    stoic and aloof, but is actually extremely caring to the point of being nosy.
    Gets mistaken for an Order Paladin a lot.  Favorite phrase is \u201CStand your
    ground!\u201D Indispensable in combat. Pretends to hate the name Carly. "

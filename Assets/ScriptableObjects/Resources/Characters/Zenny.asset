  Biography: "A honey-tongued, profit minded individual from the Fennec Fox tribe,
    who dwell deep within the deserts in Arcanist territory. Gets along with adventurers
    really well, despite adventurers and adventuring being generally untrustworthy
    and unprofitable. The smile is all business, but you can\u2019t help but fall
    for it anyways.   Loves money and people. Great with negotiations. Full name
    is Zenith. "

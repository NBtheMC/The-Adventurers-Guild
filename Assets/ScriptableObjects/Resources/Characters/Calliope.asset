  Biography: A wandering bard. Compulsive wanderer, but their wanderlust has sated
    a bit after meeting the varied personalities of the Guild. Carries strings around,
    but would rather listen to people over drink rather than play to a crowd. Cannot
    keep a secret. Gossip is part of their being.  Knowledgeable about both people
    and the outdoors. Not the best in a fight. There is no correct pronunciation.

  Biography: "Originally from a port town, they were a little too curious about what
    lay further inland. Their underfoot physique isn\u2019t exactly top sailor material,
    either. One fateful day, they hitched a ride in a merchant caravan and ended
    up here. All for the better, because the Guild has not seen a better scout.  
    Speedy. Smiling. Short. Skillful scout. Just don\u2019t expect them to bring
    much power to a fight. Is there even anything to shorten? "

  Biography: "An unusual combat-seeking mage with an equally unusual hair color.
    Full name is Sebastian Elric de Rochefort, second son of the Rochefort house
    that holds considerable power within the Arcanist faction. Left home because
    they were tired of restraints on their magic and constantly being compared to
    their siblings. Feels right at home at the Guild because everyone sings praises
    about their magic.\t  Thrives in combat situations. Surprisingly level-headed
    when angry. Would rather be called Bast. "
